# Project Brief: DublinDash

## Vision Statement
Create a joyful, accessible multiplayer browser game that celebrates individuality through personalized avatars while fostering a sense of shared journey and friendly competition in beautifully generated worlds.

## Problem Statement
Modern multiplayer games often feel impersonal and overly competitive. Parents want to share meaningful digital experiences with their children that are safe, creative, and celebrate what makes each person unique. This game creates a space where players can see themselves represented in a fun, privacy-conscious way while enjoying simple, accessible gameplay that brings people together.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Teens/young adults who appreciate indie game aesthetics and humor
- **Secondary**: Developers who want to see creative GenAI integration
- **Tertiary**: Streamers looking for entertaining multiplayer content with unique visuals

## Core Value Proposition
DublinDash offers:
1. **Personal Connection**: See yourself as a playful 3D character using safe, low-fi camera capture
2. **Instant Accessibility**: No downloads, accounts, or complex controls - just click and play
3. **Emergent Social Play**: Navigate through crowds of real players in shared journeys
4. **Beautiful Variety**: Procedurally generated worlds with Minecraft-inspired biomes
5. **Fair Competition**: Skill-based progression that rewards improvement, not grinding

## Domain Context
- **Genre**: Casual multiplayer racing/navigation game
- **Inspiration**: Crossy Road aesthetics, Minecraft Legends movement, .io game accessibility
- **Platform**: Browser-based for maximum accessibility
- **Privacy**: COPPA-compliant approach to image capture (no storage, instant low-fi conversion)

## Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: Average session time > 10 minutes
- **Retention**: 30% day-1 retention rate
- **Multiplayer**: Average 10+ concurrent players per world
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps on mid-range devices
- **Accessibility**: < 3 seconds from URL to gameplay

## Technical Considerations

### Development Philosophy
- **Performance First**: Smooth gameplay on modest hardware
- **Privacy by Design**: No personal data storage, instant image processing
- **Rapid Iteration**: Hot reload, component-based architecture
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on desktop, tablet, and modern mobile browsers

### Deployment Context
- **Scale**: Start with single server, design for horizontal scaling
- **Users**: Target 100 concurrent players initially, scale to 1000+
- **Environment**: Cloud deployment with CDN for static assets
- **Constraints**: Minimize server costs while maintaining responsiveness

### Integration Landscape
- **WebRTC**: For real-time multiplayer communication
- **WebGL**: For 3D graphics rendering
- **Camera API**: For avatar generation
- **WebSockets**: For game state synchronization

## Project Constraints
- **Timeline**: 1-shot implementation goal (comprehensive planning phase)
- **Budget**: Minimal - use free/open source tools where possible
- **Team**: Single developer with AI assistance
- **Technical**: Must work in modern browsers without plugins

## Risk Factors
- **Technical**: WebRTC complexity for multiplayer synchronization
- **Performance**: Maintaining 60fps with many players on screen
- **Adoption**: Getting critical mass of concurrent players
- **Privacy**: Ensuring camera feature feels safe for parents

## Out of Scope
- Mobile app versions (initial release)
- User accounts and persistent progression
- In-game chat or communication
- Monetization features
- Complex combat or interaction mechanics

## Open Questions
1. Optimal number of players per world instance?
2. Best approach for low-latency multiplayer state sync?
3. How to handle network disconnections gracefully?
4. Procedural generation seed strategy for consistent worlds?
